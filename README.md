# Learning-To-Rank-Using-Linear-Regression
The goal of the problem is to solve the Learning to Rank (LeToR) problem using Linear Regression. For the given LeToR and synthetic datasets, linear regression models are trained using closed-form solution and stochastic gradient descent (SGD).  The given datasets are partitioned into training set (80%), validation set (10%) and testing set (10%) such that they do not overlap.   For the hyper-parameters such as M, µj , Σj , λ, η (τ) , the model parameter w on the training set is trained from the closed-form solution and stochastic gradient descent (SGD).  The regression model is validated on the validation set and the hyper-parameters are changed to give a better performance on the validation set.  Then the performance of the model on the testing set is tested by fixing the hyperparameters and model parameters. This shows the ultimate effectiveness of the model’s generalization power gained by learning.
